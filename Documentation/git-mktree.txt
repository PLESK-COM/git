git-mktree(1)
=============

NAME
----
git-mktree - Build a tree-object from formatted tree entries


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git mktree' [-z] [--missing] [--batch]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Reads entry information from stdin and creates a tree object from those entries.
The object name of the tree object built is written to the standard output.

OPTIONS
-------
-z::
	Input lines are separated with NUL rather than LF.

--missing::
	Allow missing objects.  The default behaviour (without this option)
	is to verify that each tree entry's hash identifies an existing
	object.  This option has no effect on the treatment of gitlink entries
	(aka "submodules") which are always allowed to be missing.

--batch::
	Allow building of more than one tree object before exiting.  Each
	tree is separated by a single blank line. The final newline is
	optional.  Note - if the `-z` option is used, lines are terminated
	with NUL.

INPUT FORMAT
------------
Tree entries may be specified in any of the formats compatible with the
`--index-info` option to linkgit:git-update-index[1]. The order of the tree
entries is normalized by `mktree` so pre-sorting the input by path is not
required.
